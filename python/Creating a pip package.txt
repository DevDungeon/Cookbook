Creating a pip package
======================

Examples

* https://github.com/DevDungeon/HelpDeskBot
* https://github.com/NanoDano/tcp_blackhole

Create a new directory to hold your package
-------------------------------------------

* Create a folder for your module. Should be lowercase and underscores.
* Create a setup.py in the base directory with the following template

      from setuptools import setup
      setup(name='package_name',
            version='0.1.1',
            description='Description.',
            url='https://github.com/NanoDano/package_name',
            author='NanoDano',
            author_email='nanodano@devdungeon.com',
            license='MIT',
            packages=['package_name'],  # The folder with the real code
            scripts=['bin/executable'], # List of executable scripts to include
            zip_safe=False,
            install_requires=['dependency_package'])

* Create a sub-directory named after the package name to store the source code
* Create an __init__.py in the new folder


Executable scripts
------------------
Add scripts to a bin/ directory and define them in the setup.py file. Create a .cmd file for Windows and a shell script with a shebang for Linux/Mac. Refer to the examples provided for how to build the scripts.


Set up ~/.pypirc (Optional)
---------------------------

      [distutils]
      index-servers=pypi
      [pypi]
      repository = https://pypi.python.org/pypi
      username = DevDungeon
      password = <password>

Registering a package
---------------------
No registration step is required. By uploading a new package it automatically registers.


Compile for source distribution at minimum
------------------------------------------

      pip install twine # tool to push to pypi
      python setup.py sdist  # Package the release file
      twine upload ./dist/<package_file>
